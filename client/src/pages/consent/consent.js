        You are invited to participate in a research study. Participation in
        this research study is voluntary. The information provided on this form
        is to help you decide whether or not to participate.
      </p>

      <h2>Important Information You Need to Know</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          - The purpose of this study is to understand how users rate
          credibility of sources based on multiple tweets on social media. In
          this study, we have masked the names of the sources, and we are asking
          you to read multiple tweets including text and images and assess the
          credibility of the source of those tweets.
        </li>
        <li>
          - We are asking individuals who are age 18 or older and fluent in
          English to participate. Participation will take approximately 30-45
          minutes in total.
        </li>
        <li>
          Upon completion of the study, you will earn a minimum of $1.00 through
          Amazon MTurk.
        </li>
        <li>
          - Please read this form in order to decide whether to participate in
          this research study.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why are we doing this study?</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of this study is to measure peopleâ€™s assessment of Twitter
        news sources without knowing the identity of the source. For example,
        for a source of news X (could be CNN or Fox News for example, but you
        will not see the name in the study) you will go through multiple tweets
        with text and with or without images from that source. When you feel
        like you have enough information to assess the source, you will rate
        whether you find that source X credible, and whether you believe the
        source to be left leaning or right leaning. Please note that not all the
        details of this study are shared with you before the study. After you
        complete the study, we will explain in more detail, information about
        the study you are partaking in.
      </p>

      <h2>Why are you being asked to be in this research study?</h2>
      <p>
        You are being asked to be in this study because you are age 18 and older
        and are fluent in English.
      </p>

      <h2>What will happen if I take part in this study?</h2>
      <p>
        If you choose to participate in this study, you will complete a
        computer-based task in which you will make judgments about credibility
        of sources of news on Twitter. After completing the task, you will be
        asked some questions about your experience as well as basic demographic
        questions (age, level of education, biological sex). Your total time
        commitment if you choose to participate will be approximately 30-45
        minutes.
      </p>

      <h2>What benefits might I experience?</h2>
      <p>
        You will not benefit directly from being in this study. The broader
        benefits of this research include improved scientific understanding of
        how users decide to trust news on social media.
      </p>

      <h2>What risks might I experience?</h2>
      <p>
        We are showing you Tweets from different real political social media
        news accounts with different political affiliations and orientations,
        there is a slight chance of emotional distress, since some tweets could
        be highly emotional or politically charged. However, this would not be
        any different from tweets or posts publicly available on Twitter.
      </p>

      <h2>How will my information be protected?</h2>
      <p>
        Research data collected as part of this study will remain confidential
        to the fullest extent possible and will only be disclosed with your
        permission or as required by law. Identifiable information (Amazon
        Mechanical Turk IDs) will be stored separately from all other data
        collected during this study. Records of your responses during the task
        will be linked to identifiable data (your MTurk ID) only for payment
        purposes; your information will be permanently deleted when your payment
        is processed. Until that point any identifiable information will be
        stored in protected databases accessible only to the researchers or
        University administrators, on University-managed infrastructure.
      </p>

      <h2>How will my information be used after the study is over?</h2>
      <p>
        After the study is complete, study data may be shared with other
        researchers for use in other studies or as may be needed for publishing
        our results. The data we share will NOT include information that could
        identify you.
      </p>

      <h2>Will I receive an incentive for taking part in this study?</h2>
      <p>
        You will receive a minimum payment of $1.00 through Amazon Mechanical
        Turk upon completion of the study. If you decide to withdraw from the
        study prior to completion you will not be eligible for payment.
      </p>

      <h2>What are my rights if I take part in this study?</h2>
      <p>
        It is up to you to decide to be in this research study. Participating in
        this study is voluntary. Even if you decide to be part of the study now,
        you may change your mind and stop at any time. You do not have to answer
        any questions you do not want to answer.
