\n","The quotes around some words or phrases make the tweet seem ironic or sarcastic which sounds biased\n","seems like a source trying to report easy news with local crime, etc.\n","The images made it seem like the writer was expecting the faces of the tweeted individuals would look a certain way. The political orientation seems centered\n","Many of the headlines are more-or-less straightforward, but some add context or language to influence our ideas (Trump heads to Japan among concerns about N. Korea...). Some of the tweets exist to share the public reaction to the information rather than the information itself.\n","The poor grammar and choice of words contribute to the lack of credibility of the account. \n","There was a variety of tweets mostly not political\n","Tweets were a mix of both right wing and left wing notions.\n","This sources used some quotes. It appears to just be stating unbiased news.\n","I am not sure if some of the tweets were from reliable source.\n","Headlines feel relatively neutral though maybe slightly conservative but no titles seem overly exaggerated or extreme. \n","SEEMS LIKE A NEWS SOURCE.\n","Stated news in a way that leads me to an opinion. Tweets missing key info.\n","Some tweets they kept a neutral spot on the event, but other tweets they were heavily towards Trump. Not much bad mouthing and slight bias in reports makes me think they are credible enough for events but will have a slight bias towards the right.\n","Addressing Trump in a negative light definitely made the tweets seem more left-oriented; however, the meals on wheels tweet confused me because the \"cops were attacked.\" It sounded like the police were in the favorable light which made it seem more moderate. The sources also used parenthetical phrases to describe politicians' motives. It came across as disbelieving of whatever the politician stated and made it seem more biased to me.\n","no subjective language\n","\n","There was no distinct bias toward either the right or the left. It seemed like it reported the facts with minimal opinion.\n","The tweets you picked i couldn't figure out if they were biased or unbiased.\n","These seemed more like local news headlines so I was more comfortable in saying they were more credible.\n","This account cover local to national news and doesn't use many connotative words so I would consider them as a credible source, thought not entirely sure. I am not very sure of their ideology.\n","These tweets are fairly \"calm\" and don't contain many value judgements that would give away their political views. However, a few tweets used rhetoric that imply they are slightly left-leaning. Since the tweets are straightforward and generally lack loaded language, they appear fairly reliable. \n","The language in the tweets was objective for the most part. I had difficulty finding bias towards either side but it seemed to speak highly of Jay-Z who I believe is liberal so I think it may be slightly left-leaning.\n","These tweets seem to be based on facts or being able to prove factual occurrences. \n","The Tweets seemed credible because it used quotations when stating things that other people/sources said, showing that there is no bias or added information making it not credible. The Tweets were straight to the point and stating facts in normal rhetoric so it sounded credible. The unproblematic rhetoric and use of quotations for words that Trump said gives off the vibe that the account doesn't want its words twisted and associated with the right wing ideology, so I chose the left political orientation. \n","This source seemed to give unbiased headlines. Once again, there is only one line to judge off of, but I felt this source commented on a variety of topics w/o being bias.\n","The text and the picture showed and talked about what was actually happening in society. It was kind of easy yo make a decision.\n","The source covered lots of topics not related to politics which makes me believe that it is mostly neutral in political orientation. But at the same time, the source describes stories related to the right-wing political orientation when it shows this side as bad. I believe it is somewhat credible as it does not show many opinions in the text. \n","Like before, it's impossible to tell their political standing due to the tweets provided.
